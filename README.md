# User-Authentication-Using-Keystroke-Dynamics
📜 Description
Keystroke Dynamics is a behavioral biometric technique that analyzes the unique typing patterns of individuals. The way you type — the rhythm, speed, and timing between key presses — forms a distinctive pattern that can be used for user authentication.

In this project, we leverage keystroke dynamics to build a secure user authentication system. This method adds an additional layer of security beyond passwords, helping to mitigate threats like stolen credentials or replay attacks.

Key Features:
✅ Capture user's typing patterns
✅ Analyze timing metrics (key hold time, flight time, latency)
✅ Train machine learning models to recognize valid users
✅ Support continuous and static authentication
✅ Improve cybersecurity with minimal impact on user experience

🚀 How It Works
Data Collection
The system captures the timing of keystrokes:

Hold Time: Time a key is pressed down

Flight Time: Time between key releases and next key presses

Feature Extraction
Typing patterns are converted into numerical features suitable for model training.

Model Training
A classifier (such as SVM, Random Forest, or Neural Networks) is trained on genuine user patterns and impostor attempts.

Authentication
During login, a new typing sample is compared to the user's profile to determine authenticity.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Languages: Python

Libraries:

pynput / keyboard (for keylogging in GUI apps)

pandas and numpy (for data manipulation)

scikit-learn (for machine learning)
